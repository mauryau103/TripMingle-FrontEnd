            deaths on the island and the populated areas surrounding the lake,
            with an overall death toll of about 6,000. Because of its proximity
            to populated areas and its eruptive history, the volcano was
            designated a Decade Volcano, worthy of close study to prevent future
            natural disasters."

        text="The start of the trek was easy.  The trails were wide, established, with the ascension being gradual.  My only complaint about this hike is that since it occurred in the middle of the summer season in the Philippines, it is a bit too hot with no wind even if the trails are mostly forested.  That is the one bad thing about hiking in the summer compared to hiking during the rainy season.  The heat of the sun would constantly beat up on you that you run into a risk of either heat stroke or dehydration even if the weather would stay calm most of the time.  Good thing here in Mount Daguldul thereâ€™s quite a lot of rest stops along the way that sells Buko Juice, soft drinks and even Halo-Halo because quite a number of local Batanguenos call this mountain their home."
